## 🚀 Exciting Update Alert: Revolutionizing Customer Experience with Data-Driven Dashboards! 📊

📞 Ever wondered what happens behind the scenes when a customer calls our contact center? 🤔 I'm thrilled to share a game-changing project I've been working on – a dynamic dashboard showcasing the intricate call flow journey!

🔑 Key DAX metrics including Total Call Time, Average Call Time, Successful Calls, AHT (Average Handling Time), and insights into both successful and abandoned calls have been meticulously integrated into our dashboard. With these insights, we're empowered to fine-tune our strategies and enhance customer interactions like never before!

💡 But that's not all! One of the highlights of this project is the implementation of an advanced time analysis tool using Power Query's Advanced Editor. By creating a comprehensive timetable with diverse time bins, we can delve deep into time-based patterns and optimize our operations efficiently.

👨‍💻 Crafting this dashboard has been an exhilarating journey, and I'm incredibly proud of the impact it's poised to make in elevating our customer experience strategies.
